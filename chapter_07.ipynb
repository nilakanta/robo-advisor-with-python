    "Fama and French found that, historically from 1962-1989, small cap stocks outperformed large cap stocks and high book-to-market stocks (\"value stocks\") outperformed low book-to-market stocks (\"growth stocks\"). This potential irrationality in the market is sometimes referred to as an anomaly. This led to an extension of the one-factor model to a three-factor model:\n",

Because the risk-free rate is subtracted from the market returns, it too can be considered a portfolio that is long the market and short a risk-free bond. In academia, the Fama-French alphas are computed for papers that claim they discovered an anomaly, to show that the anomaly is not merely a manifestation of one of these two anomalies from Fama and French. There is also a philosophical debate among academics about whether the outperformance of these factors is due to irrationality in the market, or whether they are proxies for exposures to systematic risks that are not captured by market risk. And some have argued that what seems like an irrationality in the market may not be an irrationality at all and may be the result of data mining. Indeed, growth stocks, which had significantly underperformed value stocks during the Fama-French period that ended in 1989, have significantly outperformed value stocks over the last 15 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Fama and French, many additional factors have been proposed. Another common factor is Momentum. There is a long body of literature, starting with Jagadeesh and Titman, that find that stocks that have outperformed over the last 12 months continue to outperform. At the same time, there was a debate in the academic literature about whether mutual funds have a \"hot hand\", which is the notion that mutual funds that have done well in the past are able to repeat their outperformance. Many academics, who were proponents of market efficiency, believed that any outperformance was due to luck and not repeatable. But there was some evidence that surprisingly found the opposite result. Mark Carhart argued that many winning funds had an exposure to momentum stocks, which is why they became winners. And if momentum stocks tend to outperform, then the hot hand is merely due to exposure to a Momentum factor. This led to the four factor Fama-French plus Carhart:\n",

    "where MOM is a time series of returns of a portfolio of stocks that have had positive 12-month momentum and short stocks that have had negative momentum.\n",

    "More recently, Fama and French have updated their model to include two additional factors, RMW, which is the difference in returns between a portfolio of companies that have high, or robust, operating profitability minus companies that have low, or weak, operating profitability, and CMA, which is the difference in returns between a portfolio of companies that have low, or conservative capital expenditures minus companies that have high, or aggressive, capital expenditures:\n",
